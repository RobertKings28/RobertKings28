<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:</h2>
What‚Äôs good? I‚Äôm Thando Robert Tinto, a third-year Application Development student at CPUT with one mission: to turn dope ideas into clean code.
Right now, I‚Äôm grinding my way toward becoming a full-fledged Software Engineer, leveling up my skills in Java, Springboot, Android Jetpack Compose, React & HTML5. When I‚Äôm not debugging or crushing coursework, you‚Äôll catch me binging anime, making music, designing clothes for my brand "Robert Kings" or debating about Ai taking over (You know the day is coming) .
I‚Äôm all about building solutions that matter‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a slick mobile app, a clutch automation script, or just making tech work without the extra headache.

### Career Counselling Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation**  
During career readiness training, I learned to connect my personal strengths with professional goals through structured self-assessment exercises.

I needed to:
- Distinguish between temporary jobs and meaningful careers
- Identify my core strengths and values
- Create a SMART career development plan

**Action**  
I:
1. Documented my skills through journaling and peer feedback
2. Used provided worksheets to prioritize fulfillment over status
3. Set specific tech skill milestones (e.g., "Complete 3 Python projects by December")

**Result**  
Now I can:
- Break big goals into achievable steps
- Confidently evaluate career options
- Stay motivated through value-aligned objectives

### Skills and Interests Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation**  
The program showed how workplace dissatisfaction often comes from misaligned values.

**Task**  
I needed to:
- Define my core values
- Understand how they guide decisions
- Analyze past experiences through this lens

**Action**  
I:
1. Studied example value conflicts (family time vs. high salary)
2. Reviewed when I felt most/least engaged at work/school
3. Ranked my top 5 values using assessment tools

**Result**  
I now:
- Filter opportunities through my values
- Can explain my work preferences clearly
- Seek roles matching my autonomy/teamwork balance
